## About Me
Hi Everyone! My name is Yesenia and I am a first year MURP student *(although technically this is my second year at UCLA as a graduate student).* I am in the MPH/MURP dual degree program and started my first year with MPH coursework. I was born and raised in Southeast Los Angeles and although I love traveling and have entertained the thought of moving more times than I can count, Los Angeles just has a special place in my heart.
During my free time, I love trying new foods *Another reason why I Love LA, the FOOD!*. I also like being a tourist in my own city and exploring new areas and places that I have never been whether locally, or traveling to different countries!
